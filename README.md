Setup/Running the App
---------------

1. Make sure you point your Apache DocumentRoot at the `/public` folder. The app is initialized from the `index.php` file in your `/public` folder.

2. Run 'php composer.phar install' in the main project folder to update all the required package dependencies for the app.
